## INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, technology changes at a faster rate and it can be difficult to keep the pace. Mobile applications come and go, and become obsolete in matter of months. Also, mobile application’s market is very vast and has many options. Therefore, if we want to create an app that excels in the market, we have to be aware of what is already out there and what extra value can we offer so the user chooses us instead of the competition.  For that purpose, throughout this document we will review and analyze to applications: ** Otter ** and ** Mimo. ** During the analysis, we will take into account Nielsen's heuristics to determine if the applications have a proper user interface design.

## OTTER

[Otter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aisense.otter) is a smart note-taking app developed by AISense, that empowers you to remember, search, and share your voice conversations [1]. At the moment, Otter only works with English language and it’s available for Android and iOS.

Otter allows you record or input audio (Figures 1 and 2), then the app processes it and displays the transcripts of what is being said in the audio. Otter was announced at the Mobile World Congress 2018. It incorporates AI to perform speech recognition, speaker separation and identification, this means that Otter is able to identify multiple participants in a conversation. To assure security and privacy, Otter uses an encrypted connection to sync data and stores it a secure cloud environment.

As part of my work as a Software Engineer, I have performed interviews to get to know the client’s needs and requests. Usually, it is hard to pay attention to the client and also write down the important details of the meeting. Therefore, one of the reasons I chose this application it’s because I find it very useful to be able to record the session with the client (with their consent) and to read the transcript afterwards. The fact that the app gives you the transcript  makes work easier, because then you can go over the transcripts and audio; and maybe write some extra notes.
Otter can be used either by students for lectures or team work, and by people working in any other field such as business, journalism, teaching, etc. For example, it can ease the making of the meeting minutes and make them even more accurate.

Another reason for choosing this application is its usage of AI. Nowadays, AI is being widely used in personal assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home. It is refreshing to see it used in another kind of application that can be as useful as the personal assistants. AISense developed Ambient Voice Intelligence which powers Otter and makes it learn and improve constantly.

Among Otter’s strengths, I would say that during my time using Otter, I have found it very easy to use. Since the app uses AI and Ambient Voice Intelligence, Otter’s speech recognition keeps improving to make it more accurate. Otter has a user-centered interface which makes it easy to understand and get along with. Also, as shown in the Figures 3,4 and 5, it provides a short but effective Onboarding when you first install it to help you get around the main feature.

As mentioned previously, Otter is able to identify multiple participants in a conversation and it also lets the user add or search participants tags as seen in the following figures. It also lets you edit the transcripts if you have any correction.

Otter offers a free plan which gives you 600 minutes a month, which is great when you’re a student, a freelancer or if you just want to try the app to see if it works for you before actually going for a paid plan.

I think it is very useful when applications give you the option of signing up with Google or other platforms because it makes it easier than keeping track of many passwords.

Otter also allows you to create groups to share your recorded audios and transcripts, which makes collaborative work easier. The app also gives you the option of recording audio from a connected Bluetooth device, which makes it very flexible on its use.

As shown in Figure 11, another good functionality is that it lets you go through the transcript and the audio at the same time, which is great if you have any corrections or notes to do.

Although Otter has a lot of great things, there are still some weaknesses to work in. There still is a long way to go regarding the speech recognition. For starters, it works only for English language which narrows a lot the market in which it can be used.

Also, when a different English accent comes in to play, the transcripts are not that accurate (see Figures 3 and 5). For this example, Otter got most of the words right but did not manage to understand all of them. On previous tests, it also struggled to get my last name right. So, considering that English native speakers and ESL have many different accents and names sometimes hard to pronounce, the fact that Otter struggles with these two situations represents a huge disadvantage for the application. Although, these are problems that all voice interaction platforms struggle with, and there are many people working to improve this technology, so it should work better in the near future.

I would suggest to keep working on the speech recognition to make it more accurate, supporting different languages to make their market wider and consider fulfilling the heuristics that were not met in this first analysis. We will explore these heuristics next in the document.

Otter makes sure that the user is always informed about the system current status, their account status and what is going on at the moment in the application; which satisfies the _Visibility of System Status_ heuristic (see Figures 4,5, 12, 13 and 14).

The language used is simple, understandable, colloquial and relatable for the target user base; which satisfies the Match between the _System and the Real World_ heuristic.


Regarding the _User control and freedom_ heuristic, it does not completely fulfill it. Otter does not offer a redo or undo option neither for editing the transcripts or deleting the conversations, which can cause some trouble if a user edits or deletes a conversation accidentally. Although, when deleting a conversation, the app double checks if that’s correct and lets you know that this action is permanent.

The design and format presented through the application are consistent and familiar for the target user base. It uses a simple and minimalist design that matches the Material Design widely used on Android apps lately. Also, the icons and buttons used throughout the app are the ones that are commonly used, and the colour palette used is nice to the eye. Otter mostly satisfies the _Focus on Aesthetic and Minimalist Design_ and _Consistency and Standards_ heuristics, except for one little thing that bothers me about the consistency.

If we look at the low menu on Figure 13, we can notice that the section we are in is highlight with the icon being all blue. However, the recording option does not look like a button since in other parts of the application, action buttons are showed as round. The user could get confused on how the application highlights the section they're in.

As seen in Figure 13 and mentioned in the previous paragraph, Otter highlights the menu icon of the section in which the user is currently in. Therefore, is easy for the user to navigate through the app without getting lost. Throughout the app, the options are visible and easy to find, it does not take too many clicks to get to an option or action. This fulfills the _Recognition rather than recall_ heuristic and also involves a little bit of the _Provide Flexibility and Efficiency of Use_ heuristic. Regarding the last heuristic, even for a novice user the app is very easy to use. However, I could not find any shortcuts provided for the more experienced user.

About the _Help Users to Recognise, Diagnose, and Recover from Error_ heuristic, the only error that came across is the incorrect credentials error. The error is expressed in plain language and precisely.
However, in Figure 17, the error tooltip is displayed above other error which the user is not able to read.

For the _Prevent Errors_ heuristic, in my experience, it was not easy to make errors. The options and actions are very straight forward. Otter, as seen in Figure 18, provides guidelines for the password so the user can be aware of these requirements and procure a safe and valid password.
Regarding the _Provide Flexibility and Efficiency_ of Use heuristic, even for a novice user, the app is very easy to use. However, I could not find any shortcuts provided for the more experienced user.

Last but not least, _Help and Documentation_ heuristic is also covered by Otter. The app offers a Support section where you can go through the FAQ or send an specific report towards Otter’s support team.


## MIMO
[Mimo](https://getmimo.com/) is an app where you can learn about computer science, coding, building apps, etc. in a fun and interactive way [5] and is available for Android and iOS. At the moment, Mimo offers a wide variety of courses such as Mobile Development, Web Development, Game Development, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Task Automation, Programming languages such as Ruby, Java, Kotlin, C99, C#, Swift, PHP, Javascript and Python; and Developer Essentials such as Git and Command Line.

The main reason Mimo was chosen is because, although there are many platforms that already offer this type of content, what Mimo brings to the table is the possibility of doing it on the go from your mobile phone. The great thing about having this portability is that you can learn about coding anywhere you want. You can make the most of your commuting or waiting times and use them to learn something useful.

Mimo uses a very interactive, easy and user friendly approach to teach coding lessons which makes it perfect for when you are just starting to learn coding or a new programming language. Mimo breaks down information in a way that feels very light and easy to understand. You’ll find yourself getting familiar with the concepts and syntax without much effort. It is a great way to get to know about coding and start learning more about it. It is also good to practice and refresh known concepts.


Initially, Mimo lets you go through the basic levels and after that it asks you to purchase the premium version. Although, you can try it for free for 7 days. Mimo costs 29.99 USD a year, which I feel is a good deal for all the courses. I am even considering paying the subscription. The app appears to be developed as a native android application which makes it more reliable.

Among Mimo’s strengths I would list: easy to use, very practical, portable, affordable and user friendly. As a weakness, I feel that just one week to try is very little time to actually explore and get to know the app. My suggestion is that would be good if they could include one more level in the free version so the user can really get to know the dynamics of how they teach and can be more convinced about purchasing premium. Another option could be extending the premium trial for 15 days or a month, instead of the current 7 days.

Now, we will proceed to evaluate Mimo according to the Nielsen’s heuristic starting with the _Visibility of System Status_ heuristic. While I was making use of Mimo, I did not came across any loading bar or some other indication of some process taking place, but most of the processes transitioned quickly so maybe that is why the progress bars did not show up. However, it does shows the progress of the user according to the process that they’re doing at that moment (see the following figures).

In spite of its tech nature, Mimo manages to use a simple and easy to understand language. It procures to explain the technical concepts as clear as possible. Mimo target user base can include beginners to more experienced coding users, so it has to be clear enough to both spectrums. Therefore, Mimo does fulfill the _Match between system and the real world_ heuristic.

Regarding the _User Control and Freedom_ heuristic, I do not think they have achieved this one. You can go back on your answers to change the previous one but it erases any progress you did after that question which can be very irritating for the user.

In addition, there was one occasion where I accidentally pressed the back button, lost my trial and I could not find the way to get the trial again. Another case is after adding a course to your list, there is no visible way to remove it.

I tested Mimo’s login using my Google account and by creating an account from scratch. With the first option, Mimo showed a set of questions to put up a curriculum about what you already know and what you are looking forward to learn. However, when creating an account from scratch, it did not show any curriculum. When you do not fill in the curriculum, the side menu is not displayed completely when trying to access to your added courses (see figure 34) and it does not tell you what to do the curriculum or take you so you can answer the questions. There is no way to access the curriculum if not from the beginning (see the following figures). The latter breaks the Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors heuristic.

Mimo’s UI is very clean, polished and minimalist. The UI follows must of the Material Design principles. Given its course nature, it could be very easy to show screens bloated with text but Mimo manages to show the right amount of text to make the concepts understandable. The design throughout the application is consistent, there are no crazy twists that could confuse the user about the behaviour of the buttons or text fields. Mimo fulfills the _Aesthetic and minimalist design_ and _Consistency and Standards_ heuristics.

Mimo has set rules for the account’s password which you can immediately see when setting up your account or login in, which helps to fulfill the _Error Prevention_ heuristic.

Also, if the user tries to leave the text field blank, the system shows a tooltip remarking the password requirements and it won’t let you submit your information until you fulfill the requirements.

Regarding the _Recognition rather than recall_ heuristic. Mimo gives the user a set of options when given the chance of filling the curriculum. The application shows the options for experience and programming languages of which the app has courses to offer. This approach makes it easier for the user to choose an answer rather than providing it theirselves, which could lead to many senseless answers or the user could not know any programming language and feel uncomfortable of not knowing what to answer. Mimo also highlights the section in which the user currently is (see figure 38 or 39).

Concerning the _Flexibility and efficiency of use_, Mimo does not comply these heuristic. There are not advanced settings for the more experienced user, the app assumes every user is novice, or maybe its intention is to have the app understandable for every type of user. Mimo does not offer any shortcuts or accelerators either. I could not find hard task to do, most task are very seamless to do.

Last but not least, we will go over the _Help and documentation_ heuristic. Mimo offers a Help section, which they provide via zendesk. Help desk already has default sections and F.A.Q. However, it does not offer an option to ask a question directly in the Help desk. The user can send feedback via email, but that is another section. In my opinion, this could be confusing for the user. Nevertheless, help section does offer useful, clear, clean and meaningful information. Additionally, it has a search bar which makes it easier for the user to find the information they need.


## CONCLUSION
Certainly, it is important to keep Nielsen’s heuristics in mind when designing the UI/UX of our mobile applications. Likewise, it is also important to consider our target user base, their needs and ways of understanding. All of these to be able to design an appropriate user interface for our users, so they enjoy using our application and remain loyal.

Even though nor Otter or Mimo fulfilled completely all the heuristics and have aspects to improve, both have the potential to succeed.
