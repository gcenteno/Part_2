## INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, technology changes at a faster rate and it can be difficult to keep the pace. Mobile applications come and go, and become obsolete in matter of months. Also, mobile application’s market is very vast and has many options. Therefore, if we want to create an app that excels in the market, we have to be aware of what is already out there and what extra value can we offer so the user chooses us instead of the competition.  For that purpose, throughout this document we will review and analyze to applications: ** Otter ** and ** Mimo. ** During the analysis, we will take into account Nielsen's heuristics to determine if the applications have a proper user interface design.

## OTTER

[Otter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aisense.otter) is a smart note-taking app developed by AISense, that empowers you to remember, search, and share your voice conversations [1]. At the moment, Otter only works with English language and it’s available for Android and iOS.

Otter allows you record or input audio (Figures 1 and 2), then the app processes it and displays the transcripts of what is being said in the audio. Otter was announced at the Mobile World Congress 2018. It incorporates AI to perform speech recognition, speaker separation and identification, this means that Otter is able to identify multiple participants in a conversation. To assure security and privacy, Otter uses an encrypted connection to sync data and stores it a secure cloud environment.

As part of my work as a Software Engineer, I have performed interviews to get to know the client’s needs and requests. Usually, it is hard to pay attention to the client and also write down the important details of the meeting. Therefore, one of the reasons I chose this application it’s because I find it very useful to be able to record the session with the client (with their consent) and to read the transcript afterwards. The fact that the app gives you the transcript  makes work easier, because then you can go over the transcripts and audio; and maybe write some extra notes.
Otter can be used either by students for lectures or team work, and by people working in any other field such as business, journalism, teaching, etc. For example, it can ease the making of the meeting minutes and make them even more accurate.

Another reason for choosing this application is its usage of AI. Nowadays, AI is being widely used in personal assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home. It is refreshing to see it used in another kind of application that can be as useful as the personal assistants. AISense developed Ambient Voice Intelligence which powers Otter and makes it learn and improve constantly.

Among Otter’s strengths, I would say that during my time using Otter, I have found it very easy to use. Since the app uses AI and Ambient Voice Intelligence, Otter’s speech recognition keeps improving to make it more accurate. Otter has a user-centered interface which makes it easy to understand and get along with. Also, as shown in the Figures 3,4 and 5, it provides a short but effective Onboarding when you first install it to help you get around the main feature.

As mentioned previously, Otter is able to identify multiple participants in a conversation and it also lets the user add or search participants tags as seen in the following figures. It also lets you edit the transcripts if you have any correction.

Otter offers a free plan which gives you 600 minutes a month, which is great when you’re a student, a freelancer or if you just want to try the app to see if it works for you before actually going for a paid plan.

I think it is very useful when applications give you the option of signing up with Google or other platforms because it makes it easier than keeping track of many passwords.

Otter also allows you to create groups to share your recorded audios and transcripts, which makes collaborative work easier. The app also gives you the option of recording audio from a connected Bluetooth device, which makes it very flexible on its use.

As shown in Figure 11, another good functionality is that it lets you go through the transcript and the audio at the same time, which is great if you have any corrections or notes to do.

Although Otter has a lot of great things, there are still some weaknesses to work in. There still is a long way to go regarding the speech recognition. For starters, it works only for English language which narrows a lot the market in which it can be used.

Also, when a different English accent comes in to play, the transcripts are not that accurate (see Figures 3 and 5). For this example, Otter got most of the words right but did not manage to understand all of them. On previous tests, it also struggled to get my last name right. So, considering that English native speakers and ESL have many different accents and names sometimes hard to pronounce, the fact that Otter struggles with these two situations represents a huge disadvantage for the application. Although, these are problems that all voice interaction platforms struggle with, and there are many people working to improve this technology, so it should work better in the near future.

I would suggest to keep working on the speech recognition to make it more accurate, supporting different languages to make their market wider and consider fulfilling the heuristics that were not met in this first analysis. We will explore these heuristics next in the document.



## MIMO
[Mimo](https://getmimo.com/) is an app where you can learn about computer science, coding, building apps, etc. in a fun and interactive way [5] and is available for Android and iOS. At the moment, Mimo offers a wide variety of courses such as Mobile Development, Web Development, Game Development, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Task Automation, Programming languages such as Ruby, Java, Kotlin, C99, C#, Swift, PHP, Javascript and Python; and Developer Essentials such as Git and Command Line.

The main reason Mimo was chosen is because, although there are many platforms that already offer this type of content, what Mimo brings to the table is the possibility of doing it on the go from your mobile phone. The great thing about having this portability is that you can learn about coding anywhere you want. You can make the most of your commuting or waiting times and use them to learn something useful.

Mimo uses a very interactive, easy and user friendly approach to teach coding lessons which makes it perfect for when you are just starting to learn coding or a new programming language. Mimo breaks down information in a way that feels very light and easy to understand. You’ll find yourself getting familiar with the concepts and syntax without much effort. It is a great way to get to know about coding and start learning more about it. It is also good to practice and refresh known concepts.


Initially, Mimo lets you go through the basic levels and after that it asks you to purchase the premium version. Although, you can try it for free for 7 days. Mimo costs 29.99 USD a year, which I feel is a good deal for all the courses. I am even considering paying the subscription. The app appears to be developed as a native android application which makes it more reliable.

Among Mimo’s strengths I would list: easy to use, very practical, portable, affordable and user friendly. As a weakness, I feel that just one week to try is very little time to actually explore and get to know the app. My suggestion is that would be good if they could include one more level in the free version so the user can really get to know the dynamics of how they teach and can be more convinced about purchasing premium. Another option could be extending the premium trial for 15 days or a month, instead of the current 7 days.



## CONCLUSION
Certainly, it is important to keep Nielsen’s heuristics in mind when designing the UI/UX of our mobile applications. Likewise, it is also important to consider our target user base, their needs and ways of understanding. All of these to be able to design an appropriate user interface for our users, so they enjoy using our application and remain loyal.

Even though nor Otter or Mimo fulfilled completely all the heuristics and have aspects to improve, both have the potential to succeed.
